# weratedogs_project

"We rate dogs" is a twitter account that rates dogs sent by the account's followers. The rating of these dogs is with a denominator of 10 and a numerators that is larger than that (e.g., 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc...). The reason for this unusual way of rating is that these dogs are "good dogs".

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email for this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

Retweet count and favorite count have been provided using the twitter API, and every image of the dogs were ran through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs.

The data has been assessed , cleaned, and combined into a master data set. This data will be used to try and answer the following quetsions:

Is a certain dog stage more likely to be rated higher or lower

What are the top 5 breeds with the highest favorite count

Is there a corelation between the favorites and the retweet count

What are the top 5 most common breed
